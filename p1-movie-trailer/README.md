### First things, First

In order to properly run this Movie Trailer Website, you will need to first make sure you have the necessary version of source code and Python environment on your computer.

<br \>

![Python icon](img/Sm-pylogo.png)

If you don't already have [Python 2](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2710) installed on your computer, you can use the link to download and install it now. This program was created using the latest Python 2.7 version (Python 2.7.10). Running this with Python 3 could possibly cause some unexpected issues.

*Note: If you are a Mac OS user, be sure to utilize the appropriate Version that matches your current operating system. See the Description column for details.* 

<br \>

#### IDLE or Terminal

**IDLE** is an easy, user-friendly environment to view and run this program. If you just installed Python 2, you're in luck! IDLE is part of the package.

However, I personally prefer to work within a Mac OS **Terminal**. By navigating to the appropriate directory, one can simply type the below command to run a python script (since python comes preinstalled on Macs):

    $ python [ filename ].py

<br \>

<br \>

### What's under the hood
---
In the folder `scripts`, you'll notice the following files:

+ entertainment_center.py
+ fresh_tomatoes.py
+ media.py

Although all three .py files are necessary to run the program, the one you will utilize to run the project is `entertainment_center.py`. So, let's save this one until last!

<br \>

#### Media.py

In this file, you will find the **_class_** __Movie__ and all of the appropriate code to initialize all of the movie media information included in entertainment_center.py. 

<br \>

#### Fresh_tomatoes.py

This python file holds all of the structural code to generate an HTML file to run the Movie Trailer Website. At the top, you will also notice **(#commented out)** the personalized adjustments I made from the original code provided by the Udacity team.

<br \>
   
#### Entertainment_center.py
__IDLE__

* To run this program, open this .py file in IDLE.
* Click 'Run' on the navigation bar and then 'Run Module'.
* Then, the program should generate a HTML file (i.e. _fresh_tomatoes.html_, seen above) where you can view the movies and watch each movie trailer.

__Terminal__

* To run this program, open a terminal (or Command Prompt for Windows users). 

    *Note: Python doesn't come preinstalled on Windows machines so you must first install a version in order to run python in Cmd.*

* Navigate to the `scripts` directory and type:

        $ python entertainment_center.py

* Press Enter and a new `fresh_tomatoes.html` will be generated.

<br \>

<br \>


If you would like to run other operations, you can comment out the last two lines of this file and type the appropriate code underneath.

Like the fresh_tomatoes.py file, there are comments and citations included in this document.
